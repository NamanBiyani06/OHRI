Next task is to calculate the KFRE for 2 year and 5 year risk rates
- eGFR from 2009 CKD and 2021 CKD formulas

- 0 is caucasian, 1 is anyone else
- divide all values of creatinine by 88.42 --> 1mg/dL = 88.4 umol/L

Wednesday Aug. 2nd 2023 Meeting Recap
- Fix the report
  - Check all the dates for dates that are past todays date. Get the pt_id for those patients
  - Calculate the minimum and maximum age for age data
  - For patransf_where, 0 is potentially death. Remove those patients from the 0 count as they are not alive.
- Death Issues
  - Create a different column for death
  - If patient has died, death column = 1, else 0
- Outliers
  - Instead of providing the index of outliers, provide the pt_id of the outliers
- Race
  - 1 is african, 0 is everything else
- New dataset
  - This dataset is based off of status.xlsx.
  - Delete the following columns: cs pt alive, cs cod, period, cs cododth, patransf_other, access_iod
  - Add first_pri_date
  - Add three boolean columns: Dialysis/Transplantation, Death, Other
  - Add a column called Event_Date which will be the date that the above events happened.
  - Dialysis/Transplantation occurs on the dotransf_pri.
  - Death occurs on the cs_dod.
  - Other occurs on the fup_date.
  - If the patient has a dod, Death = 1, else 0
  - If the patient has a patransf_where of 2-7, Dialysis/Transplantation = 1, else 0
  - If neither of the above are true, Other = 1, else 0
- Other
  - For the 8 variable KFRE dataset, serum bicarbonate is known as total_co2

FIRST CLEAN DATA

- Discrimination
- Calibration
- Brier Score

- If the difference between the first pri date and the last fup date is less than two years, the patient is not useful for validation of the 2 year KFRE as their outcome is not known (This can be fixed by a cox regression, however do not focus on this right now).
- If the difference between the first pri date and the last fup date is less than five years, the patient is not useful for validation of the 5 year KFRE as their outcome is not known (This can be fixed by a cox regression, however do not focus on this right now).
- If the patient has died within the 2 year time frame, their outcome is unknown and they are not considered useful either.

- For the 2 year KFRE, the patient must have a fup_date that is at least two years after the first_pri_date and they must not have died within the two year time frame.

- Add 8 variable KFRE

- There is a problem with the calculator. Get the results within Â± 

- flow diagram of total number of patients and how many are excluded transfered to: n and percentage
- exclusions are for 4 variable goes in excluded, not died or transplanted, and left clinic within two years for two year and five year for five year

- What I am looking for with the outcomes is whether or not something happens to the patient within the two year time frame. If they die within 2 years, the outcome == 0. If they receive a transplant or dialysis within 2 years, the outcome == 1. If they receive a transplant/dialysis or they die after 2 years, their outcome is 0. If they are followed for more than 2 years and nothing happens to them in the 2 year time frame, their outcome is 0.

Here's the summary for the code:
- The first task is to exclude data that is not useful for validation.
- The patient will be excluded if:
  - The is a missing KFRE for the time frame (this is possible due to missing input date)
  - The patient has left the clinic within the time frame, having not died or recieved dialysis/Transplantation
- The next task is to create an outcome column that will indicate what happened to the patient
- The patient will be given an outcome of 0 if:
  - The patient has died within the time frame
  - The patient has not died, not required dialysis/transplantation within the time frame
  - The patient has required dialysis/transplantation, or died after the time frame
  - They have been followed for at least two or more years but have end the study without an event (other)
- The patient will be given an outcome of 1 if:
  - They received dialysis/transplantation within the time frame
- By following this outcome algorithm, we will end up with a binary dataset, that can be used for discrimination.

An important consideration to note, is that exclusions must be tracked and reported for the creation of the flow chart.
