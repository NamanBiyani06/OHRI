Next task is to calculate the KFRE for 2 year and 5 year risk rates
- eGFR from 2009 CKD and 2021 CKD formulas

- 0 is caucasian, 1 is anyone else
- divide all values of creatinine by 88.42 --> 1mg/dL = 88.4 umol/L

Wednesday Aug. 2nd 2023 Meeting Recap
- Fix the report
  - Check all the dates for dates that are past todays date. Get the pt_id for those patients
  - Calculate the minimum and maximum age for age data
  - For patransf_where, 0 is potentially death. Remove those patients from the 0 count as they are not alive.
- Death Issues
  - Create a different column for death
  - If patient has died, death column = 1, else 0
- Outliers
  - Instead of providing the index of outliers, provide the pt_id of the outliers
- Race
  - 1 is african, 0 is everything else
- New dataset
  - This dataset is based off of status.xlsx.
  - Delete the following columns: cs pt alive, cs cod, period, cs cododth, patransf_other, access_iod
  - Add first_pri_date
  - Add three boolean columns: Dialysis/Transplantation, Death, Other
  - Add a column called Event_Date which will be the date that the above events happened.
  - Dialysis/Transplantation occurs on the dotransf_pri.
  - Death occurs on the cs_dod.
  - Other occurs on the fup_date.
  - If the patient has a dod, Death = 1, else 0
  - If the patient has a patransf_where of 2-7, Dialysis/Transplantation = 1, else 0
  - If neither of the above are true, Other = 1, else 0
- Other
  - For the 8 variable KFRE dataset, serum bicarbonate is known as total_co2
